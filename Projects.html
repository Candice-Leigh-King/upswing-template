      development and job creation while preserving the environment. Each
      project upholds a strict ethos of developing skills while maintaining the
      dignity of all living things in diverse ways for diverse people. UpswingSA
      hosts a variety of workshops and opportunities to earn a wage by making
      use of the surplus of textile waste. Some of our main projects

        UpswingSA operates a thrift store in Cape Town to help fund its
        community impact work and offer a sustainable alternative to fast
        fashion. The store supports the organization’s mission of reducing
        overconsumption, landfill overcrowding, and textile waste—aligning with
        the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.  All items sold are donated by
        community members looking to responsibly part with used clothing and
        goods.

        Each donation is carefully sorted and processed by hand; usable items
        are cleaned and resold, while damaged goods are salvaged for upcycling.
        Profits, after covering operating costs, are reinvested into the
        organization’s daily initiatives. Over seven years, the thrift store has
        processed thousands of kilos of waste goods and created employment
        opportunities for more than 20 women through store operations and our
        Resellers Initiative.
