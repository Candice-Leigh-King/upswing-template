      textarea: >-
        UpswingSA operates a thrift store in Cape Town to help fund its
        community impact work and offer a sustainable alternative to fast
        fashion. The store supports the organization’s mission of reducing
        overconsumption, landfill overcrowding, and textile waste—aligning with
        the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.  All items sold are donated by
        community members looking to responsibly part with used clothing and
        goods.

        Each donation is carefully sorted and processed by hand; usable items
        are cleaned and resold, while damaged goods are salvaged for upcycling.
        Profits, after covering operating costs, are reinvested into the
        organization’s daily initiatives. Over seven years, the thrift store has
        processed thousands of kilos of waste goods and created employment
        opportunities for more than 20 women through store operations and our
        Resellers Initiative.

      textarea: >-
        UpswingSA offers craft workshops aimed at upskilling the local community
        by teaching participants how to repurpose scrap fabric and waste
        materials into sellable products. These workshops also create employment
        opportunities through basic alteration and tailoring services.
        Additionally, the Craft Corner initiative focuses on children and teens
        (ages 5–17), providing creative activities like sewing, decoupage,
        jewellery making, and upcycling. The program encourages self-expression
        while teaching sustainable practices and raising awareness about
        environmental responsibility and climate impact.

      textarea: >-
        UpswingSA runs an internship program that provides youth with hands-on
        training in retail, marketing, and social media, helping them gain work
        experience and tackle youth unemployment in South Africa. Additionally,
        the Craft Your Future fellowship supports young creatives by teaching
        upcycling skills such as crafting and sewing, empowering them to
        generate income through the sale of handmade products.

      subheading: Community Connections
      textarea: >-
        UpswingSA has supported the local community through a range of outreach
        projects, including the donation of postnatal care packs to Mowbray
        Maternity Clinic, educational resources and toys to local schools, and
        food and supplies to old age homes and orphanages. Guided by our core
        value of upholding human dignity, we are committed to providing
        meaningful support through empowerment rather than dependency. As part
        of this approach, UpswingSA actively partners with and contributes to
        local initiatives that uplift vulnerable individuals by offering a hand
        up, not handouts.

        Keep up with our community initiatives through our social media links.
