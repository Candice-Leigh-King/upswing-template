      <p>UpswingSA, the brainchild of Ayishabibi Gaffoor and Fatima Hoosain, was
      founded as a response to the ongoing unemployment and poverty on the Cape
      Flats. </p><p>The number of people who suffer as a consequence of bad
      politics, poor economy and a lack of skills in various degrees were the
      main reasons for the creation of UpswingSA.</p><p>The organization
      registered first as The Skills Development Programme but later started to
      trade as UpswingSA. </p><p>UpswingSA has at its heart what world leaders
      are trying to address. We see these issues brought forward through the
      United Nations Sustainable Development Goals of 2015. </p><p>Goal 12 in
      particular, which talks about responsible consumption and production of
      resources, is a key focus area for UpswingSA. The goals of UpswingSA is in
      line with other UNSD goals ie, alleviating poverty, redressing gender
      inequality through industry innovation.</p><p></p>
