      <p>UpswingSA, the brainchild of Ayishabibi Gaffoor and Fatima Hoosain, was
      founded as a response to the ongoing unemployment and poverty on the Cape
      Flats. </p><p>The number of people who suffer as a consequence of bad
      politics, poor economy and a lack of skills in various degrees were the
      main reasons for the creation of UpswingSA.</p><p>The organization
      registered first as The Skills Development Programme but later started to
      trade as UpswingSA. </p><p>UpswingSA is at its heart what world leaders
      are trying to address. We see these issues brought forward through the
      United Nations Sustainable Development Goals of 2015. </p><p>Goal 12 in
      particular, which talks about responsible consumption and production of
      resources, is a key focus area for UpswingSA. The goals of UpswingSA
      remain inline with other UNSD goals including alleviating poverty,
      redressing gender inequality through industry innovation.</p><p></p>

      textarea: >-
        UpswingSA is currently expanding its skills development programme by
        launching a craft workshop focused on activities like decoupage, sewing,
        crochet, upcycling, and jewellery making. 


        The workshop aims to empower unemployed individuals by teaching them to
        repurpose waste materials into marketable items. 

        Additionally, we host craft classes with affordable pricing, which are
        also offered to children on weekends and holidays.

      textarea: >-
        While UpswingSA's main focus is skills development, it launched a thrift
        store to help fund the organisation. Over the past five years, the store
        has become self-sustaining, employing two full-time and three part-time
        staff, and offering work experience to trainees from various
        institutions. The thrift store accepts donated goods to reduce landfill
        waste, sells affordable items, supports women resellers, offers a
        swapping option, sells second-hand school uniforms and textbooks, and
        provides a clothing alteration service to the community.
